OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:-
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline, as it ensures that the data is clean and suitable for modeling. Here's a breakdown of the preprocessing steps included in the code:

LOADING THE DATASET:

Reads the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
Checking for Missing Values:

Identifies missing values in the dataset.

HANDLING MISSING VALUES :

Fills missing values in the 'Age' column with the mean of the column.
Drops any remaining rows with missing values.
Identifying and Encoding Categorical Features:

Identifies categorical features in the dataset.
Applies one-hot encoding to convert categorical features into numerical format.
Splitting Data into Features and Labels:

Separates the dataset into features (X) and labels (y).
SCALING FEATURES![Screenshot (46)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75ca22a5-df53-43db-98ba-3a74ddb4a9b7)
:

Uses Min-Max Scaler to scale the features to a range between 0 and 1.
Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets:

Divides the data into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
These preprocessing steps are essential to ensure that the data is in the right format and scale, and that it is free of missing values and properly encoded for use in machine learning models.
